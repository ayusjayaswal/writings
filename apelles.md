There is a thing about machines nowadays, they are fast, very fast. But, everything feels slow more opaque and often mysteriously complex.
The funny part is, as our machines have evolved to be faster and more efficient software scene has been opposite. Software goals have moved 
from bringing best of hardware to making more money for thier overlords. 

These need not be this complex, we don't need everything behind a GUI, a simple new feed does not need to eat a gigabyte of my RAM. The point is
to go back to basics and keep things simple stupid.

# About Apelles
    Now, one thing I would clear beforehand, Apelles is NOT A RICE. It's supposed to be a suite of Software, some written exclusively for the project,
    others may be from different places but will fit together like "clockwork". What sets Apelles apart is emphasis on simplicity.



# Philosophy
    This is the core of why Apelles OS should exist. A lot of it stems with my own frustrations with the current approach to "consumer" software.
